                        <p>The purpose of the video that we watched in class is to let gay people know tat they don't have to be alone even if they think that they are. It does this by telling a personal story about how he turned into exactlly what his uncle was and how he would have been there holding his hand if he would have known. Sadly in the video he tells how his Uncle Ronnie took is own life after becoming divorced and not being able to see his children anymore. After becoming an exact capy of his uncle he learns how it feels and how he wishies he could have told his Uncle while he was still alive that he was there for him. In the video he stuctures his message by starting with a story of the past and then telling part of his own life. I could use the way this video is strctured to help change my project by referning my story back to my life to help better explain the purpose of my project.</p>
